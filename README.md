# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by!  

If you found this page through my resume — I appreciate you taking the time to explore my work.  
This GitHub serves as a portfolio of my C++ development projects, with a focus on **object-oriented design, algorithmic analysis, and systems engineering**.  

My flagship project, **[Sugar_Bot (C++)](https://github.com/PepsiSucks/sugar_bot)**, demonstrates a modular trading-strategy framework built entirely in modern C++.  
It showcases my understanding of data structures, encapsulation, and software architecture — all written with readability and performance in mind.  

In addition to my C++ work, you’ll also find projects from my background in **industrial maintenance and PLC automation**.  
These illustrate my ability to bridge **software and hardware**, combining programming fundamentals with real-world system integration.

### Highlights
- **Modern C++ (C++17/C++20)** – focus on modular design, templates, and clean abstraction  
- **Technical Trading Frameworks** – data-driven indicators, strategies, and backtesting  
- **Industrial Controls Experience** – process automation, PLC logic, and system reliability  
- **Adaptable Engineering Mindset** – comfortable moving between code, hardware, and analysis

Feel free to browse through the repositories and projects — each represents a step in how I approach complex problems, both digitally and physically.  
Thank you for taking the time to look through my work!
