If you found this page, then you're looking at some of the projects that I have going and you probably got here by following a link in my resume, thank you for taking the time to look at my work. The repositories are where I organize my projects. 
If you found this page on your own, then congratulations! There are some files for industrial maintenance and my own personal projects here.
